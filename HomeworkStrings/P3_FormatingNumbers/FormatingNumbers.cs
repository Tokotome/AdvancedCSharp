//Write a program that reads 3 numbers(separated by whitespace): an integer a(0 ≤ a ≤ 2222), a floating-point b and a 
//floating-point c and prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console.Each column should have a width of 10 characters.
//The number a should be printed in hexadecimal, left aligned; then the number a should be printed in binary form, padded 
//with zeroes(if it is bigger than 10 bits remove the least significant ones), then the number b should be printed with
//2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned; the number c should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned.
